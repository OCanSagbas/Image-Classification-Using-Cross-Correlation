# Image-Classification-Using-Cross-Correlation
Using cross correlation to classify images refer to American Sign Language.

Background

Cross correlation is used in signal processing to obtain the measurement of similarity between two signals by implementing dot product in a sliding window. As images (grayscale) are two dimensional signals, cross correlation can be used in images for template matching

 For this purpose I must carry out the following steps:

• Calculate the cross correlation You will calculate the cross correlation for each target image and the template to obtain the offsets and the peak signals.

• Compare the peak signals You will compare the peak signals for each template.

• Choose the maximum peak You will choose the maximum peak with respect to the given template to classify the target image.

• Classify You will classify the target with respect to the maximum peak of the template.
